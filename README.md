# Al Bundy's Sales Analysis - Confidence Interval of Shoe Sales using Inferential Statistics and MS Excel
## Project Objective
Using MS Excel and Inferential Statistics, the objective is to compare the confidence interval (CI) of Al Bundy's shoe sales in the United States in the year 2014-2016 with 95% confidence level. Also, to compare the shop performance of US1 and US2. This is for the inventory of  the shoes to know what sizes are to order more and what are the order less to avoid random ordering of shoe stocks.

## Data used
- <a href = "https://github.com/pagonzales/Inferential_Statistics_Al-Bundy_Shoe_Sales_Analysis/blob/main/AI%20Bundy%20Dataset.xlsx">Dataset</a>
## Questions
- With 95% confidence level,
  - What are the confidence interval of shoe sales in terms of its sizes in the United States. Compare the following years (Calculate in terms of Male and Female):
    - 2014-2015
    - 2015-2016
    - 2014-2016
  - What is the number of shoes that are likely to be sold in the period 
    - 2014-2015
    - 2015-2016
    - 2014-2016
  - Compare the result using t-statistic and z-statistic
  - By how much does the one shop outperforms the other in terms of sales (Use US1 shop and US2 shop)

## Process
- Make a distribution table that is based on categories such as,
  - Shoe size
  - Country
  - Gender
- Given that Al Bundy is operating for more than 30 years, we can apply the Central Limit Theorem
- Then, we can assume normality and create a distrubution frequency table of United States sales in terms of shoe size (as rows) and month (as columns)
- After this, we can now proceed to calculate the mean, standard error, margin of error, and get the confidence interval. Also, rounding off the pair of shoes is important (do this for each year bracket like in the Questions section).
- Repeat the creation of distribution frequency table for comparing the shop performance of US1 and US2 in terms of sales.
